Hello! I am second year PhD student in Political Science and Government at Yale University. My research lies at the intersection of comparative politics and political economy. In particular, I am interested in accountability, bureaucracies, and the political economy of development.

Prior to joining Yale, I worked as a pre-doctoral research assistant at the World Bank and MIT’s Global Diversity Lab. I received my BA from Ashoka University, India, and an MA from Yale University’s Economics Department.
